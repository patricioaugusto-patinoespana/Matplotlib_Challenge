# Matplotlib Challenge

## Pymaceuticals 

We are going to analyze study_results.csv and mouse_metadata.csv that it's going to show us, several plots, of the behavior of several Drug Regimens, if the 
tumor, increases, decreases or mantein their volume, and also we are going to analyze, only one Drug Regimen that is Campulin, that it is one that demostrate 
that have more effectivity. 

## Files Include

In the Matplotlib Challenge folder you will find the Resources folder and the Analysis Folder and the pymaceuticlas.jpynb file. In Resources folder we have the 
mouse_metadata.csv and study_results.csv files that contains the Data we need to analyze with the pymaceuticals.jpynb file with Python, and the Analysis is in 
the Analysis Folder, it's a word document that contains all the analysis we found with the Python file.

## Instructions 

Open de pymaceuticals.jpynb, a Python file with Jupyter NoteBook, the code is commented by section so you know what the code does, and run all code.

## Usage 

With this Phyton file we can be able to analyze 2 csv files and merge them, and have several charts for analyze the behavior of tumor volume with different 
Drug Regimens, and be able to know if they increases or decreases, and chosse one Drug Regimen, and know the behavior of this, also knowing what happens when 
the mouse have more weight. 

## Results 

With all the Data we obtain we can say that Campulin and Ramicane have more effectivity with the Tumor volume, and Ketapril and Naftisol have the lowest 
effectivity in the treatment, and only analyzing Campulin with only one mouse we can observe that the treatment works and the mouse, and has a significant 
decrease in the first 20 days, and after the day 40 has a decrease but not the same way at the beginning, and another important data for this, is that mice 
that have more weight, their tumors have more volume.
